Table 1 - Providers (Employees).
-- Notes:
-- We need a page to Enter the the details for the employees (Providers)
-- This page is only accessable to the Admin (How to do this????)


Table 2 - Services

-- We need to have a page to Enter the services that the salon has, Also it needs to be tied to one of the 
    providers, basically a drop down menu with a list of the names of the providers.
-- If we can somehow be able to select multiple providers that give that service and not have to do for each seperately 
    would save alot of time.
